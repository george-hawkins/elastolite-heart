ELastoLite beating heart
========================

This project involved [ELastoLite](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/elastolite-hookup-guide/all), a [pulse sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11574) and a transparent panel.

At one stage, I looked at using something more accurate than a cheap simple pulse sensor. In particular, I looked at the [Mio Alpha](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alphaheartrate/alpha-the-holy-grail-of-heart-rate-look-ma-no-hand), one of the very early high accuracy heart rate monitors in watch format (until then the watch format had been very inaccurate compared to chest straps).

Note: Mio produced various devices over several years but has now morphed into [PAI Health](https://www.paihealth.com/) and no longer produce devices directly available to consumers. There is also a company called Mio Labs that uses a very similar logo to Mio and produces a device called the [mioPod Cardio Pilot](https://mio-labs.com/pages/tech) but it seems unclear if they have anything to do with Mio (the Mio Labs website avoids giving away any information about who is actually behind it).

The panel was made up of two stickers.

An outer one with the sticky surface on the opposite side to the graphic (as with most stickers):

And an inner one with the graphic on the same side as the sticky surface (as with a sticker one places on the inside of a window to be seen by those outside):

With the two stuck together to form a non-sticky panel (the inner sticker providing more masking for the area that should let through light).

The stickers were ordered from [vistaprint.ch](www.vistaprint.ch) on Febuary 28, 2014 as _Kleine Fensteraufkleber_.
